# ✒️ Tiny Count

A simple, no-nonsense word count plugin for Sublime Text.

- Selections: Tiny Count measures the whole buffer, but will also report on any active selections as they become available.
- Ignores comments: in Markdown, [Fountain](https://github.com/lichendust/meander-sublime), or any other active syntaxes, anything marked as a comment in the active syntax highlighter won't count toward the total.
